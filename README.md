# MyMathsLibrary
A Unity project with a bunch of custom math functions.

So far I've recreated several of Unity's built-in math functions and classes, mainly related to Vectors, Matrices and Quaternions, which has allowed me to rebuild the transform and box/sphere/capsule collider components from scratch. Eventually, I plan to completely recreate the rigid-body system, to help improve my understanding of the underlying systems which game engines like Unity utilise.

Some code is adapted or taken from other sources. These cases will be clearly labelled as such. All hyperlinks in the code will also be listed here:
