# MyMathsLibrary
A Unity project with a bunch of custom math functions.

So far I've recreated several of Unity's built-in math functions and classes, mainly related to Vectors, Matrices and Quaternions, which has allowed me to rebuild the transform and box/sphere/capsule collider components from scratch. Eventually, I plan to completely recreate the rigid-body system, to help improve my understanding of the underlying systems which game engines like Unity utilise.
